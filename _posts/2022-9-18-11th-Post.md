## Question
#### 'solution receives number(n) that is 1 < N < 800,000,000 and it returns by descending order 

_Example output_    <br>
_n     |   return_    <br>
118372 |    873211      <br>

## My answer

```javascript
def solution(n):
    #int to list with descending order   
    n = sorted([i for i in str(n)], reverse=True) #   n would be n = ['8','7','3','2','1','1']
    # note that descending, ascending are used list type
    # Before convert to integer, comma should be removed and convert to Integer
    n = int("".join(n))    
```

## A lesson learned
- It took 40min to write codes
- descending and ascending order can be used for list type
- A good way to convert str to int is using join(). See the above code.
- sorted() vs sort(). sort() returns nothing and makes changes to the original sequence. However; sorted() returns the a sorted list. This method doesnâ€™t effect the original sequence.
