## Question
#### You are given a string s with "a" mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. Complete a solution that compares the number of 'p' and the number of 'y' in s and returns True if they are the same, and False if they are different. If neither 'p' nor 'y' is found, it always returns True. However, when comparing counts, uppercase and lowercase letters are not distinguished.

_Example output_          <br>
_s          |  Answer_    <br>
_"pPoooyY" ->   True_      <br>
_"pyy"     ->   false_      <br>

## My answer. SolutionOne is my first code without making shorter, and I changed a few code for 2nd one for make shorter and looks tidy

```javascript
def solutionOne(s):
    pCout = 0
    yCout = 0
    for x in s.lower():
        if x in ['p', 'y']:
            if x == 'p':
                pCout = pCout + 1
            elif x == 'y':
                yCout = yCout + 1

        else:
            answer = False
        print("pCout:", pCout)
        print("yCout:", yCout)       
    return True if (pCout == yCout) else False
```

## making some change for shorter code.

```javascript
def sCountTwo(s):
    xCout = 0
    yCout = 0
    for x in s.lower():
            if x == 'p': xCout = xCout + 1
            if x == 'y': yCout = yCout + 1           
    return True if (xCout == yCout) else False
```

## A lesson learned
- It took 40min to write codes for first one and second one
- I learned "Ternary Operator" that is I was looking for a long time. [Syntax will be _[true_value] if [condition] else [false_value]_]
- I learned _Lower()_ that is string to make all lowcase. _Upper()_ is for uppercase.
- It was a little bit taking some time to figured out for loop to use len() function or not.
