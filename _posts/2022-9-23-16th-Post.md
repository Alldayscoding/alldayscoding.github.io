## Question
#### This conjecture, posed by a man named Collatz in 1937, is that all numbers can be made 1 by repeating the following operations until the given number becomes 1. Here's the job:

# My answer
```javascript
def solution(n):
    count = 0
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    while(n != 1):
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n /2
            count = count +1
        else:
            n = n*3+1
            count = count +1
    if count > 500:
        return -1
    
    return count 
```
