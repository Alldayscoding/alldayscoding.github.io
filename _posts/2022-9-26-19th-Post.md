## Question
#### Write a solution, a function that returns an array in which the values ​​divisible by the divisor are sorted in ascending order among each element of the array. If no element is divisible by the divisor, return -1 in the array.

#### _Example output_          <br>
#### arr  divisor_             <br>
#### [5, 9, 7, 10]	5	[5, 10]<br>
#### [2, 36, 1, 3]	1	[1, 2, 3, 36]<br>
#### [3, 2, 6]	    10	[-1]          <br>

# My answer
```javascript
def solution(arr, divisor):
    answer = []
    for i in arr:
        if i % divisor == 0:
            answer.append(i)   
    answer.sort()
    return answer if len(answer)>0 else [-1]
```

# Copied someone else's code for analyzing.
```javascript
def solution(arr, divisor):
    return sorted([n for n in arr if n%divisor == 0]) or [-1]
```
