## Question
#### Write a solution, a function that returns an array in which the values ​​divisible by the divisor are sorted in ascending order among each element of the array. If no element is divisible by the divisor, return -1 in the array.


| arr           | divisor       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

# My answer
```javascript
def solution(phone_number):
    star = ''
    for i in phone_number:
        star = star + '*'
    return star[:-4] + phone_number[-4:]
```

# Copied someone else's code for analyzing.
```javascript
def solution(phone_number):
return "*"*(len(phone_number)-4) + phone_number[-4:]
```



## A lesson learned
- It took me 25min to write codes. I spent 20mins for thinking and wrote code in 5min.
- Analyzed someone else's code and learned that python has _"string multiply"_ <br> For example: _<"text sample" * int>_
