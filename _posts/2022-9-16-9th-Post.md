## Question
#### array contains random integer. The solution function must return average of array. 

_Example output_    <br>
_arr         | return_    <br>
_[1,2,3,4]	 |  2.5_       <br>
_[5,5]       |  5_        <br> 


## My answer

```javascript
def solution(arr):
    return sum(arr)/len(arr)
```

## A lesson learned
- I took in 10mins as this is a easy one.
- I finally figured out one line of return statement
- Make some notes. 
 - [i for i in sample if i>2] -> for + if statement
 - [True if i > 2 else False for i in sample] -> For + if else statement
 - True if sample > 2 else False
