## Question
#### Find the position x of “Kim” among the elements of string array called seoul and complete the solution, a function that returns a String saying Mr Kim is at x”. "Kim" appears only once in seoul and there is no case where an incorrect value is entered.

# My answer
```javascript
def solution(seoul):
    answer = "Mr Kim is at" + str(seoul.index("Kim")) + "located"
    return answer 
```


## A lesson learned
- In order to get an index value from list, I can simply use _index(element, start(optional), end(optional))_
-  alternative code would be : return "Mr Kim is at {}located".format(seoul.index("Kim"))
