## Question
#### Will be given an natural number "N". It must return sum of the digit of "N" 

#### example. if the given N = 123, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. It must return 6 as the sum of digits


## My answer

```javascript
def solution(n):
    answer = 0
    n = str(n)
    for x in n:
        answer = answer + int(x)
    return answer
```

## A lesson learned
- I started at 8:30pm and resolved at 9:20pm. Took me **50 mins**
- my approach was to convert int to str. And using for loop to convert back to int and sum of digits 
- for x in n loop, x index doesn't start 0 as n as string. **where I was struggling with**
- length() is incorrect format in Python. Use len() instead.
