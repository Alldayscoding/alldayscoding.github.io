1.Learned how to set up environment python web application with Bitnami WAMP.
  - Configured httpd.conf file in conf folder to enable py extention file and excute CGI.
  - troubleshooted errors in error.log files to identify cgi error.
2.Used Atom as editor but switched back to Visual Studio code.
  - because indent feature is more powerful when save the py file in VS
3.cgi.FieldStorage
  - when data coming through from HTML, FieldStorage class creates an instance to store user data to form(FieldStorage object)
4.Form method GET vs POST
  -GET method is being cached
  -GET method can save browser history
  -GET method has length restricted
  -DO NOT USE GET method when dealing with sensitive data
5.Using redirection
  -remove all other print()
  -print("Location: index.py?id=" + title) # redirection code
