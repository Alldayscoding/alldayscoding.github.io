## Question
#### string 's' must return following :
#### string 's' can be positive or negative number string. For example) '-1234' or '4321'


# my first code : 
```javascript

def solution(s):
    answer = 0
    if s[0] == '-':
        answer = -abs(int(s[1:]))   
    else:
        answer = int(s)
    return answer
```

# I feel it's too long so I did make shorter


```javascript
def solutionTwo(s): # s = '-1234'as string
    return -abs(int(s)) if 0 > int(s) else abs(int(s))  
```

## A lesson learned
- Learned abs() and also -abs()
- String without any char can be converted to int using int()
