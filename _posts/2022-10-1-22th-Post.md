## Question
#### Complete the solution, a function of length n that returns a string that maintains a pattern like "ABABABABAB....". For example, if n is 4, return "ABAB", and if n is 3, return "ABA".

### _Example output_ <br>
- ---n--------return <br>
- ---3--------"ABA"<br>
- ---4--------"ABAB"<br>

# My answer
```javascript
def solution(n):
    answer = ''
    for x in range(n):
        if x % 2 == 1:
            answer = answer + "B"
        else:
            answer = answer + "A"
    return answer
```
 

# Someone else's code
```javascript
def water_melon(n):
    return "AB"*(n//2) + "A"*(n%2)
```


## A lesson learned
- Leanred // operator. It's called floor division which at round the result down to the nearest whole number
- String can multiply with Int. For example. "ABA"*2 will be "ABAABA"
