## Question
#### There is a random positive integer 'n'. You must verify if 'n' is the square of a number 'x'. if yes, it must return square of x+1. Otherwise return -1 

_Example output_ <br>
_n	    | result_    <br>
_121	|  144_       <br>
_3      |  -1_      <br> 

#### Output example #1 'n' is 121 and it's also square of 11, it returned 144 because of (11+1)**
#### Output example #2 'n' is 3 and 3 is none of square number, so it returned -1


## My answer

```javascript
def solution(n):
    answer = 0   
    for x in range(n):
        if n == pow(x, 2):
            answer = (x+1)**2
            break
        else:
            answer = -1
    return answer
```

## A lesson learned
- I started at 10:05pm and resolved at 10:45pm. Took me **40 mins**
- my approach was to use for loop and multiply of 'x' like (x * x) and if multiply number(X*X) is equal to n. Return answer with (x+1)**2   
- it took some time to create a logic, but it was not hard. 
- I have learned pow() function, and also duble ampersand(**) that it's for square.
