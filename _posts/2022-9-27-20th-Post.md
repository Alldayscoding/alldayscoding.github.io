## Question
#### Complete the solution, an array that stores integers, and a function that returns an array by removing the smallest number from arr. However, if the array you want to return is an empty array, fill the array with -1 and return it. For example, if arr is [4, 3, 2, 1], [4, 3, 2] is returned, and if arr is [ 10 ], [ -1 ] is returned.

### _Example output_          <br>
- arr  return             <br>
- [4,3,2,1]	-> [4,3,2]<br>
- [10] -> [-1]<br>


# My answer
```javascript
def solution(arr):
    return [i for i in arr if i > min(arr)] or [-1]
```


## A lesson learned
- sort() is making list to low to high(ascending). sort(reverse=True) is making list to High to low(descending)
- min() is to find minimum value among list elements.
