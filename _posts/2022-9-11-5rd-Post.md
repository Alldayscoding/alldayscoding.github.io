## Question
#### Find the minimum natural number that is remainder of 1

_Example output_ <br>
_n	| result_    <br>
_10	|   3_       <br>
_12 |	  11_      <br> 

#### Output example #1 Reminder of 10 divided 3 must 1, so 3 should be returned
#### Output example #2 Reminder of 12 divided 11 must 1, so 11 should be returned  



## My answer

```javascript
def solution(n):
    for x in range(1,n,1):
        if n % x == 1:
            answer = x
            break
        else:
            pass
    return answer
```

## A lesson learned
- it took me to resolve problem for 10 mins.
- x started 0 and it through the error "ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero".
- Thought x started 1 instead of 0. use range with parameter values. like range(start, stop, step).
- parameter start is always 0 as default. 
- parameter stop is n as input parameter.
- paremeter step is an integer number specifying the incrementation. Default is 1.
