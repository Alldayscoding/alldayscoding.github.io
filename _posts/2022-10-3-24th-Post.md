## Question
#### Two arrays of one-dimensional integers, a and b, of equal length are given as parameters. Complete the solution function to return the dot product of a and b. In this case, the dot product of a and b is a[0]*b[0] + a[1]*b[1] + ... + a[n-1]*b[n-1] . (n is the length of a, b)

### _Example output_ <br>
- ----a------------b------------return <br>
- -[1,2,3,4]---[-3,-1,0,2]------  3<br>
- -[-1,0,1]----[1,0,-1]--------- -2<br>

# My answer
```javascript
def solution(a, b):
    return sum([x*i for x, i in zip(a,b)])
```


## A lesson learned
- Common mistake is I kept using sum[] instead sum().
- I am able to use zip() function.
