## Question
#### 'N' is natural numbe. You must reverse N and return as a list.  

_Example output_    <br>
_n         |       return_    <br>
_12345     | [5,4,3,2,1]_      <br>

## My answer

```javascript
def solution(n):
    answer = [] 
    return list(map(int, str(n)))[::-1]
```

## A lesson learned
- It took 20min to write codes
- Learned about map() and [::-1].
- list(map(int, str(n)))) -> map(function, Iterable) 
- Iterable is used for iterate over iterable objects including _string,lists,tuples,dicts and sets_
- [A:B:C] means A is starting index. B is till end. C is interval. if C is negative, it started from backward. Just good to remember is [::-1] is equal of reversed.
