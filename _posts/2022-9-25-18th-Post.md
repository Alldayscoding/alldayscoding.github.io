## Question
#### string valule of phone_number is given, except for last four digits, replace all * for not visibilities.  

# My answer
```javascript
def solution(phone_number):
    star = ''
    for i in phone_number:
        star = star + '*'
    return star[:-4] + phone_number[-4:]
```

# Copied someone else's code for analyzing.
```javascript
def solution(phone_number):
return "*"*(len(phone_number)-4) + phone_number[-4:]
```



## A lesson learned
- It took me 25min to write codes. I spent 20mins for thinking and wrote code in 5min.
- Analyzed someone else's code and learned that python has _"string multiply"_ <br> For example: _<"text sample" * int>_
