## Question
#### The integer array numbers containing some of the numbers 0 through 9 is given as a parameter. Complete the solution function to find all the numbers 0 through 9 that cannot be found in numbers and return the sum.

### _Example output_ <br>
- -----------n---------------return <br>
- ---[1,2,3,4,6,7,8,0]--------14<br>
- ---[5,8,4,0,6,7,9]-----------6<br>

# My answer
```javascript
def solution(n):
    a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]
    return sum([x for x in n + a if x not in a or x not in n])
```

# Someone else's code
```javascript
def solution(numbers):
    return 45 - sum(numbers)  //because sum of 0 to 9 is 45. 
```


## A lesson learned
- sum() can be used list. Ex., sum([1,2,3,4])
- Two list can be addition each other. list a + list b will be total of a,b
