## Question
#### The function solution should take an integer x and a natural number n as inputs, and return a list containing n numbers starting from x and increasing by x. Look at the following constraint conditions, and complete the function or solution that satisfies the condition.


# my first code : 
```javascript

def solution(x, n):
    answer = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        i = i*x
        answer.append(i)
    return answer
```

# Someone else code to analyse

```javascript
def solutionTwo(x, n): 
    return [i * x + x for i in range(n)]
```

## A lesson learned
- To check if data are iterable, use the dir() method. If you can see the magic method _iter_ then data are iterable.
- Remember! int object is not lterable. Loop should use range() for single Int. Ex. _for i in range(n)_
- someone else code is that I was confused about arithmetic operators _i*x+x_. (i*x) is first and second is x
