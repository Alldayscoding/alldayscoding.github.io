## Question
#### Complete the solution, a function that takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of all divisors of n.

_Example output_ <br>
_n  | result_    <br>
_12	|  28_       <br>
_5  |  6_        <br> 

#### Output example #1 A given number n is 12. 1,2,3,4,6,12 are divisors of 12. The total of divisors is 28 
#### Output example #2 A given number n is 5. 1,5 are divisors of 5. The total of divisors is 6 


## My answer

```javascript
def solution(n):
    answer = 0
    for x in range(1, n+1):
        if n%x == 0:
            answer = answer + x
    return answer 
```

## A lesson learned
- I started at 10:45pm and resolved at 11:40pm. Took me **55 mins**
- This is a straightforward question and I had no issue at all to make a code.
- However; it took some time because I wanted to make my code shorter. I tried one line return code but I was not able to find any.
- I found someone else code >>  return num + sum([i for i in range(1, (num // 2) + 1) if num % i == 0]). I analysed and make a note for it. 
- range() reminds me with parameter valule. range(start, stop step)
