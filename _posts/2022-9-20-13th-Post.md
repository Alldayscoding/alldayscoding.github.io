## Question
#### For a positive integer x to be a Hashard number, x must be divided by the sum of the digits of x. For example, the sum of the digits of 18 is 1+8=9, and 18 is divisible by 9, so 18 is a Hashard number. Complete the solution, a function that takes a natural number x as input and checks whether x is a Hashard number.

_Example output_          <br>
_arr : return_    <br>
_10 -> True_      <br>
_12 -> True_      <br>
_11 -> false_      <br>
_13 -> false_      <br>

##

```javascript
def solution(x):
    nList = list(map(int, str(x))) 
    return True if x%sum(nList) == 0 else False 
```

## A lesson learned
- my approach is to convert int x to list and assign new val 'nList'.
- I believe list with map() function is good to approach to resolve this issue.
